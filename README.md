## General Approach

The approach I took to implement my app was to first set up the basic routes. Implement User sign in, log in, and log out. After that I displayed some product images and tried to see what values my products needed to have in my store. Once I had them displayed I created the models based on that information.
After that I concentrated on the payment process and displaying a receipt for the customer.

## Installation Instructions

Clone the repo on [GIT HUB](https://github.com/canderson22/general-assebmly-store).
